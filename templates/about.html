  <h2>Welcome to INTLog!</h2>
</p>
<p>This application was designed to help me keep track of artifacts that I may stumble across during an investigation. I was originally using things like notepad, maltego, jupyter, and a bunch of other apps. The problem I ran into is that I needed a simple wheel, not a nuclear reactor to log what I was seeing. Secondly, I wanted something that could be hosted locally and data kept on my disk. And just like that, INTLog was born. Simplicity is the name of the game here. This app caters specifically to my needs and maybe it will help you too.</p>

<p>This app is very much in early infancy. There are likely security issues, broken functions, better tools, and enhancements that _should_ be added.</p>

<h3>A note</h3>

<p>You'll notice that the favicon is a cup of coffee. This project was lovingly created while sipping coffee.</p>
